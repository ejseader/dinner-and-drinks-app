## Description

The Dinner and Drinks web application allows a user to select a random (alcoholic) drink and dinner recipe. The drink and recipe are selected randomly from the API data and the result depends on the user input. For example, in the drink section, the user can enter a generic type of alcohol and the API will return a random drink name and corresponding recipe. The dinner section functions in the same way.

Once a drink and/or dinner recipe has been selected, the user can then view those selections in the browser's local storage for use in the future. 

The application also includes current weather conditions based on the user's location. Once the user has selected a dinner and drink, it helps the user to determine whether the dinner/drink combo would best be enjoyed indoors or outdoors.
